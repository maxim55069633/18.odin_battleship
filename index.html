          Every Player has 10 ships in total (20 squares). Each ship occupies a
          number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either
          horizontally or vertically. The ships cannot overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships
          (Click on a single square). Every time a player sinks his opponent's
          ship, he can shoot one more time. When a player sinks all ships his
          opponent has, he wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every square has four states: 1. unknown place(blank square), 2.
          missed shot(interpunct), 3. hidden ship(blue square), 4. sunk ship(red
          square with cross)
